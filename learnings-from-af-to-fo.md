# Learnings From AF to FO

## What Broke Most Often
- Large lowcode outputs hit token limits and dropped required files.
- Multipart metadata from model can be inconsistent (e.g., declares final part while still truncated).
- Required files missing from manifest caused pre-QA skip loops.
- Path drift occurred under pressure (e.g., `business/frontend/package.json` vs `business/package.json`).

## What Improved Reliability
- Treat build process as stateful in harness (manifest-driven), not in model memory.
- Patch-first recovery before full regenerate reduces drift and cost.
- Carry forward prior required file inventory to defect iterations.
- Force continuation recovery whenever output remains truncated (even after multipart).
- Normalize known path drifts before validation.
- Keep pre-QA strict only for true blockers; move non-blockers to post-QA polish.

## Prompt/Contract Learnings
- Directory contract must match runtime loader contract exactly.
- Defect iterations need explicit file inventory lock + targeted edit scope.
- Required outputs must be enforced with both:
  - prompt contract
  - harness validation + automatic recovery

## Process Learnings
- Add CLI overrides for operational pressure points (iterations, parts, continuations, boilerplate path).
- Keep safety defaults aligned to governance, with explicit runtime overrides when needed.
- Always refresh manifest after any out-of-band file mutation (e.g., patch writes).

## Bottom Line
- Reliability came from harness-side deterministic controls, not expecting model session continuity.
